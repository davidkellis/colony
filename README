Colony is a small distributed task library.

Depends on:

beanstalkd http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/
mongodb http://www.mongodb.org/
zeromq http://www.zeromq.org/


Getting started:

1. Install dependencies. This is how I did it:

beanstalkd:
sudo port install beanstalkd

zeromq:
sudo port install zeromq

mongodb:
Download and install mongodb 1.6.3 from http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

beanstalk-client gem:
gem install beanstalk-client

zmq gem:
gem install zmq -- --with-zmq-dir=/opt/local      (if you're using macports)
gem install zmq                                   (otherwise)

Note: I tried to install the zmq gem with "gem install zmq", but that failed since I installed zeromq via macports.

mongoid gem:
gem install mongoid --pre
