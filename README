Colony is a small distributed task library.

Depends on:

beanstalkd http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/
mongodb http://www.mongodb.org/


Getting started:

1. Install dependencies. This is how I did it:

beanstalkd:
sudo port install beanstalkd

mongodb:
Download and install mongodb 1.6.3 from http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

beanstalk-client gem:
gem install beanstalk-client

mongoid gem:
gem install mongoid --pre

2. Try out the example in the /example directory.

First run mongod and beanstalkd.

Then run example/queen.rb, followed by example/worker.rb, then finally simple.rb.

NOTE: This example isn't fully working yet, but it gives you and idea of what I'm trying to do.
