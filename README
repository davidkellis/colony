Colony is a small distributed task library.

Depends on:

beanstalkd: http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/
redis: http://code.google.com/p/redis/

Getting started:

1. Install dependencies. This is how I did it:

beanstalkd:
sudo port install beanstalkd

beanstalk-client gem:
gem install beanstalk-client

redis:
sudo port install redis

redis gem:
gem install redis

ohm gem:
git clone http://github.com/davidkellis/ohm
cd ohm
gem build ohm.gemspec
gem install ohm-0.1.0.gem

2. Try out the example in the /example directory.

First run redis and beanstalkd.

Then run example/worker.rb, followed by example/simple.rb.
